 **Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on medical attributes.

**Project Overview**

Diabetes is a common health issue, and early detection is important.
This project uses a machine learning model trained on medical data to predict diabetes outcomes.
